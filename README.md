## Introduction

<strong>[TFCAIDM](https://pypi.org/project/tfcaidm/)</strong> is a unified framework for building and training medical imaging deep learning models for large scale experimentation built on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [JarvisMD](https://pypi.org/project/jarvis-md/). The library supports interfacing custom datasets with `jarvis`, model development with `tensorflow`, and built-in reproducibility, traceability, and performance logging for all experiments.

For all project updates, check out [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Brandhsu/tfcaidm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

The current library is supported on python 3.7 and tensorflow 2.5+, and the installation instructions provided below assume that your system is already equipped with cuda and nvcc.

<details>
<summary>Local Installation</summary>

Install using the [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) virtual environment.

Where `user` is your account username.

```sh
user $ conda create --name tfcaidm python=3.7
user $ conda activate tfcaidm
user (tfcaidm) $ pip install tensorflow
user (tfcaidm) $ pip install jarvis-md
user (tfcaidm) $ pip install tfcaidm
```

</details>

---

## Example

Training a set of models require two separate python scripts: a training submission script and a training routine script.

<details>
<summary>Training Submission</summary>

```python
from jarvis.utils.general import gpus
from tfcaidm import Jobs

# --- Define paths
YML_CONFIG = "pipeline.yml"
TRAIN_ROUTINE_PATH = "main.py"

# --- Submit a training job
Jobs(path=YML_CONFIG).setup(
    producer=__file__,
    consumer=TRAIN_ROUTINE_PATH,
).train_cluster()
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Automated Training Routine</summary>

```python
from jarvis.train import params
from jarvis.utils.general import gpus
from tfcaidm import Trainer

# --- Autoselect GPU (use only on caidm cluster)
gpus.autoselect()

# --- Get hyperparameters (args passed by environment variables)
hyperparams = params.load()

# --- Train model (dataset and model created within trainer)
trainer = Trainer(hyperparams)
results = trainer.cross_validation(save=True)
trainer.save_results(results)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Custom Training Routine</summary>

```python
from jarvis.train import params
from jarvis.utils.general import gpus, overload
from tfcaidm import JClient
from tfcaidm import Model
from tfcaidm import Trainer

# --- Autoselect GPU (use only on caidm cluster)
gpus.autoselect()

# --- Get hyperparameters (args passed by environment variables)
hyperparams = params.load()

# --- Setup custom dataset generator (more details in notebooks)
@overload(JClient)
def train_generator(self, gen_data, **kwargs):
    for xs, ys in gen_data:

        # --- User defined code
        xs = DataAugment(xs)

        yield xs, ys

# --- Setup custom model (more details in notebooks)
@overload(Model)
def create(self):

    # --- User defined code
    model = ViT(...)
    model.compile(...)

    return model

# --- Train model (dataset and model created within trainer)
trainer = Trainer(hyperparams)
results = trainer.cross_validation(save=True)
trainer.save_results(results)

# See notebooks for a breakdown on customizability
```
